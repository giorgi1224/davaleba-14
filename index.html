<hr><h2><i>What is Lorem Ipsum?</i></h2>
  <p><b>Lorem Ipsum</b> is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting <br> industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy <br> text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley <br> of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has <br> survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic <br> typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in <br> the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem <br> Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing <br> software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p> <br><h2><i>Where does it come from?</i></h2><p>Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. <br> It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, <br> making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin <br>  professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of <br> the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum <br> passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical <br> literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum <br> comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum <br> et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in <br> 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular <br> during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem <br> ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.</p> <p>The standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s <br> is reproduced below for those interested. Sections 1.10.32 and <br> 1.10.33 from "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" by Cicero are also <br> reproduced in their exact original form, accompanied by English <br> versions from the 1914 translation by H. Rackham.</p> 
</body><hr><hr><b>The standard Lorem Ipsum passage, used since the 1500s</b><p>"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad <br> minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat. Duis aute irure dolor in reprehenderit <br> in voluptate velit esse cillum dolore eu fugiat nulla pariatur. Excepteur sint occaecat cupidatat non proident, sunt in culpa qui officia <br> deserunt mollit anim id est laborum."</p><b>1914 translation by H. Rackham</b><p>"On the other hand, we denounce with righteous indignation and dislike men who are so beguiled and demoralized by the charms of <br> pleasure of the moment, so blinded by desire, that they cannot foresee the pain and trouble that are bound to ensue; and equal blame <br> belongs to those who fail in their duty through weakness of will, which is the same as saying through shrinking from toil and pain. These <br> cases are perfectly simple and easy to distinguish. In a free hour, when our power of choice is untrammelled and when nothing prevents <br> our being able to do what we like best, every pleasure is to be welcomed and every pain avoided. But in certain circumstances and owing <br> to the claims of duty or the obligations of business it will frequently occur that pleasures have to be repudiated and annoyances accepted. <br> The wise man therefore always holds in these matters to this principle of selection: he rejects pleasures <br> to secure other greater pleasures, or else he endures pains to avoid worse pains."</p><hr>
